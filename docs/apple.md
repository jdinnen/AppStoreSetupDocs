# Apple Developer Program Organization Account Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the requirements and steps to create an **Apple Developer Program Organization Account**, which is required to publish apps under your company or organization name on the App Store.

---

## 1. Account Type
Apple offers two main account types:

- **Individual Account** – For solo developers or hobby projects.
- **Organization Account** – For businesses, nonprofits, and government entities that want the organization name displayed as the seller in the App Store.
  - Requires **a legal entity** (not a DBA or trade name).
  - Must have a **real person** who acts as the Account Holder with legal authority to bind the organization to Apple’s agreements.

---

## 2. Requirements for an Organization Account
Before you start, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

### Organization Identity
- **Legal Entity Status** – Your organization must be a legal entity (e.g., LLC, Corporation, Nonprofit). Sole proprietorships and DBAs are not accepted.
- **D-U-N-S Number** – A unique 9-digit identifier issued by Dun & Bradstreet, used by Apple to verify your organization’s legal status.
- **Legal Business Name** – Must match your D-U-N-S registration exactly.
- **Business Address & Phone Number** – Used for identity and verification checks.

### Account Holder (Team Agent)
- Must be **a real person** with the legal authority to sign contracts on behalf of the organization.
- This person will:
  - Act as the **primary contact** with Apple.
  - Manage users and roles in App Store Connect.
  - Be listed as the account owner in Apple’s records.
- Apple requires direct phone verification with this individual.

### Apple ID & Authentication
- Use a **work email address** (e.g., john@yourcompany.com) — not a personal iCloud or Gmail account.
- Enable **two-factor authentication** for the Apple ID used.

### Payment & Tax Information
- A valid **credit card** for the annual $99 (USD) developer membership fee.
- Tax and banking details will be required later if your app includes paid content or in‑app purchases.

## 3. Registration Steps

1. Go to the [Apple Developer Enrollment Page](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).
2. Sign in with your **Apple ID** (create one if needed using your company email domain).
3. Select **Enroll as an Organization**.
4. Provide the following details:
   - Legal Entity Name (exactly as registered)
   - D‑U‑N‑S Number
   - Headquarters Address
   - Work Email and Phone Number
5. Apple will validate your D‑U‑N‑S information (can take 1–2 business days).
6. Apple may call or email the **Account Holder** to confirm identity and authorization.
7. Once approved, pay the **$99 annual fee** to activate your membership.
8. You’ll receive an email confirmation and can then access:
   - **App Store Connect** (manage apps, metadata, TestFlight, etc.)
   - **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** (for app signing and provisioning)

---

## 4. Verification Process
- Apple contacts the Account Holder directly via phone or email.
- The person must confirm they have authority to legally bind the company.
- Apple may request supporting documentation such as:
  - Business registration certificate.
  - Articles of incorporation.
  - Business license or government-issued proof of entity.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Use a **corporate domain** for your Apple ID (e.g., @yourcompany.com).
- Ensure your **D-U-N-S information** matches your legal registration.
- Keep the **Account Holder** information current — Apple only allows one at a time.
- Use **App Store Connect roles** to delegate access safely (Admin, Developer, Marketer, etc.).
- Renew your Apple Developer Program annually to avoid app delisting.

---

## 6. Timeline
| Step | Duration |
|------|-----------|
| D‑U‑N‑S Number request | 1–30 days (if not already registered) |
| Apple D‑U‑N‑S verification | 1–2 business days |
| Account Holder verification call | 1–5 business days |
| Account activation after payment | Within 24 hours |
