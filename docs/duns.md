# D-U-N-S Number Setup Guide

## Overview
A **D-U-N-S Number** (Data Universal Numbering System) is a unique 9-digit identifier for businesses, issued by **Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)**. It is used by organizations like **Apple** and **Google** to verify your business identity when creating developer or vendor accounts.

This guide walks through how to apply for a D-U-N-S number, what documentation is required, and how to verify your registration.

## 1. Why You Need a D-U-N-S Number
- Required by **Apple Developer Program (Organization)** for verification.
- Required by **Google Play Console (Organization)** in some regions.
- Recognized globally as a business identifier.
- Used by financial institutions, suppliers, and partners for credit and compliance checks.

## 2. Before You Start
Make sure your business is properly registered. You’ll need the following information:

### Required Business Information
- **Legal Business Name** – Must match government registration records.
- **Business Structure** – (LLC, Corporation, Nonprofit, etc.)
